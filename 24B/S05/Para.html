  Copilot agent mode can create apps from scratch, perform refactorings across
  multiple files, write and run tests, and migrate legacy code to modern
  frameworks. It can automatically generate documentation, integrate new
  libraries, or help answer questions about a complex codebase. Copilot agent
  mode helps you be super-productive by having an AI collaborator that
  understands the workspace. It can orchestrate your inner development flow
  while keeping you in control.
